## 👋 About Me

I am a lead software engineer, with deep experience designing and delivering **secure, scalable and resilient digital platforms**. I specialise in **software architecture, secure software engineering and DevSecOps**, with a strong focus on building systems that are dependable, cost-effective and maintainable over the long term.

I work across organisational boundaries, influencing technical direction, setting engineering standards and reducing systemic risk. I am comfortable operating in complex environments where architectural decisions must balance security, delivery pace, operational resilience and long-term strategy.
